/**
 * Contact model – stores contact form submissions from site visitors.
 *
 * Each submission captures a visitor's name, email, subject, and message.
 * The email field is unique-indexed, meaning each email address can only
 * submit one contact form (prevents duplicate leads from the same person).
 *
 * Accessible via:
 *  - POST /api/v1/contacts        – public, anyone can submit
 *  - GET  /api/v1/contacts        – admin only
 *  - GET  /api/v1/contacts/:id    – admin only
 *  - PUT  /api/v1/contacts/:id    – admin only
 *  - DELETE /api/v1/contacts/:id  – admin only
